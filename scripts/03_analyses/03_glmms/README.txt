Scripts in this folder are for models that use data from only forested habitat, including woodland, savanna, etc.
SES values were calculated using species that only occur within forested habitat
Resolution of verticality data is 50km

I am using sdmTMB_models2.3/taxa_sesvert_tempdiu.rds - these are models with diurnal temp range, 
which reflects the hypothesis that thermal variation impacts vertical climate distinctness
I don't use temp_sea (temp seasonality) due to strong correlations with tmin_cold
